## Summary:	
The dataset that we chose is titled US Mass Shootings, and it covers the details behind mass shootings in the United States from 1966 to 2017. 
This dataset contains information regarding the shooter, the number of people killed or injured, and overall details and summaries behind some of the mass 
shootings that occured within the fifty-one year time period. The reason we chose this dataset is because the United States has been one of the top 
countries with the most mass shootings, and the cases have been becoming more frequent and at a larger scale in recent years 
(with the most recent mass shooting case being on September 19th of this year, leaving two dead). 

## Motivation:
Following this trend in increased mass shootings in the United States, many Americans have started to speak out and advocate for stricter gun control laws 
and other preventative measures against mass shootings through movements such as the #NeverAgain gun control movement and other grassroots organizations 
and social media campaigns. Although the #NeverAgain gun control movement that was sparked in 2018 after the Parkland school shooting has died down due to 
the rise of other political and social issues, mass shootings are still occurring frequently in the United States and the controversy surrounding the issue
of gun control is still very prevalent. The contentious manner of this issue also plays a relevant role in politics, especially with the upcoming election 
in November. For many Americans, a candidate’s stance on gun control can be a deciding factor in influencing their vote. This dataset also provides insight
into other related issues of mass shootings other than gun control by including the variables of mental health and race. 
Through the dataset, we will be able to analyze different trends to see how race and mental health played a role in the mass shooting cases, 
allowing for the issue of mass shootings to be viewed more broadly and be more contextualized with other social issues. 
Also, this dataset gives more insight to the issue surrounding gun violence, which continues to stay relevant due to the controversy surrounding police 
brutality and the Black Lives Matter Movement. 

## Description of variables:
The four relevant numerical variables we will be looking at in this dataset are titled Date, Fatalities, Injured, and Total Victims. 
The date variable displays the month, day, and year the mass shooting took place; the fatalities variable displays the number of deaths from each 
mass shooting case; the injured variable displays the number of injured victims from each mass shooting case; 
and the total victims variable displays the combined number of fatalities and injuries (hence the name “total victims”).
The four relevant categorical variables we will be looking at in this data set are titled Title, Location, Mental Health Issues, and Race. 
The title variable gives the name of each mass shooting incident; the location variable displays the city and state the incident took place; 
the mental health issues variable specifies whether or not the person committing the crime has had a history of mental health issues; 
and the race variable displays the race of the shooter behind each incident.
